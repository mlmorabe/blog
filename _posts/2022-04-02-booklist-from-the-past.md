Ages ago in grad school, I toyed with the idea of writing a "Best of [x] year" list for myself. Unfortunately, as many things in grad school go, this was an idea that seemed grand for a minute until faced with the reality of time management and motivation. For the purpose of this post, though, I thought I'd look at what I was feeling strong feelings about in 2019.

```
Books of the year (those that have stuck with me):

- Song of Achilles (so sad)
- Half-Witch (kinda weird but so good)
- Witchmark (adorable!)
- Girl in the Green Silk Gown / Sparrow Hill Road (so good)
- Long Way to a Small Angry Planet (so sweet)
- The Bone Witch (so sad)
- The Poppy War (so sad)
- Nimona (so sweet and sad)
- Under the Pendulum Sun (so weird)
- Unmasked by the Marquess (so sweet)

Comfy/cozy reads:
- Snowspelled
- Odd Spirits

Reads that I keep going back to:
- Secret Casebook of Simon Feximal
- Magpie Lord series
- Ruin of a Rake
- Uprooted
- Just Like Heaven
