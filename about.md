<h1>About Me</h1>

Hello! I'm Maria (she/her). I'm a queer 1.75 gen Filipino-American currently living in the Midwest with my partner and our cat, Lotus. I study mathematical computational biology in my undergraduate years before pursuing a PhD in Microbiology. I'm not currently an active research scientist (I do freelance scientific support, which essentially means a lot of spreadsheets), but my love of marine microbes, fundamental microbiology, and ocean biochemistry still lingers.

My have too many hobbies. I dabble in sewing, fiber arts (knitting and crocheting), dice making, ceramics, photography, and woodturning. My major interests and the focus of this site are reading books and playing games. 

You can find me on twitter [@yayforbooks](https://twitter.com/yayforbooks), where I am probably fangirling about books, games, dramas, art... anything, really.
