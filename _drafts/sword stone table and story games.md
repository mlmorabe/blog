Gosh, it's been a while! Never fear that I've forgotten you, I was often in a state of "oh, I should finish writing some of the many things I've thought about writing" in the months since I last wrote. But in the way that statements that begin with "I should" go, I did not, until now!

My pandemic acquired superpower is apparently the ability to read short story anthologies. I used to be wracked with indecision about *how* to read an anthology (do you read it in order? skip around randomly? what's the *best* way??), but in these days where my attention span is increasingly selective, I'm just grateful for the way short stories are concentrated experiences of narratives. They get a lot of vibes across in a short time! (Also, thank the powers that be for the existence of novellas --- I love a novel, but also sometimes I just want to feel like I can finish things, you know!)

One of the short story collections that I've read more recently is *Sword Stone Table*, edited by Swapna Krishna and Jenn Northington. This is a collection of retellings, remixings, revisitings of the stories of King Arthur and the myths that make up Arthurian lore. In this anthology, the authors create a world of King Arthur that is full of characters and settings that aren't normally seen in Arthurian legend - the stories are "gender-bent, race-bent, LGBTQIA+-inclusive," to use the words off the back of the book. And it was fantastic to see these legends, these stories that explore love and duty and glory and loyalty and magic and the making something of oneself (and also the making of swords), be expanded to include *more* of the world that exists and the world that can be. These were, after all, the stories that I spent my childhood devouring and dreaming about being a part of. 

There are a lot of great stories in this collection (so you should go read it!), but I want to shout out a few of my favorites and imagine what games might be good frameworks or starting points for experiencing or interacting with the story in a different way. (This list is extremely non-exhaustive, not prescriptive, and like completely based off my tiny Maria's eye-view of the games out there, so if there are other systems or games that you think might work better or should be considered, I totally didn't mean to leave it out and it probably would be great!)

Okay, so a cool thing about this anthology is that it includes more traditionally sword and sorcery-set fantasy settings, modern/more contemporary settings, and futuristic science fiction settings, which is Great for giving us a lot of room for figuring out what kind of games might work. That said, I think that part of playing games inspired or based on existing stories is choosing what aspects of the story you want to bring out in your game. I don't think that games are for recreating stories, but for creating something in a similar vein. A lot of times, when I think about how I want to play a game similar to a story I've read, I think about the alternate paths the story might have gone or what might happen if *I* had a character in the story. It becomes a way of writing fanfiction, I guess. 

* "Passing Fair and Young," by Roshani Choskhi, and "I Being Young and Foolish," by Nisi Shawl, are two of my favorite stories in the more medieval/high-fantasy section of the collection. 

* "Once (Them) and Future (Us)," by Preeti Chhibber, and "Flat White," by Jessica Plummer, are in the contemporary section of the collection. Both of these stories involve characters realizing that they might have more of a connection to King Arthur than they know. These stories deal with making choices about what your life now will look like compared to the past life you might have lived. They deal with redefining relationships.
