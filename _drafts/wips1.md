I'm theoretically doing NaNoWriMo this month. That is to say: I have the vaguest plot idea and notecards with notes about characters and about 3/4 of a scene written. Somehow, I'm not sure I'll get to the end goal, but I'm going to count any amount of creativity and/or a fairly regular amount of time spent thinking/writing as a win.

Instead of writing on the one thing I wish I could write, I've spent time imagining up convoluted romantic interludes for the characters in Jane Austen's *Emma* (inspired heavily by a group watch of *Emma* 2020 directed by Autumn de Wilde) and similarly spicy if not exactly romantic interludes for NPCs in a Beam Saber campaign I am playing in.
