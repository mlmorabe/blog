*The Magic Fish* by Trung Le Nguyen (also known as Trungles) is a graphic novel about a young boy finding words between worlds, life between cultures, and the power of stories. Tiến, the main character, is trying to find the words to come out as gay to his parents, Vietnamese immigrants. His mother Hiến is far away from her own mother, having come to a new country. The graphic novel intertwines the fairy tales they read together in English with the tales of their own lives as they find the words to come together.

I had been meaning to read this book forever, but it was only recently that I finally got to! I'd constantly heard great things about it from both random people on the internet and people I trust. All those things were well-merited! I came to this book looking for a reflection of myself, words of guidance, and something like a feeling of not being alone and I think I found all of those things. 

I've always been interested in fairy tales and in the way they are told and the way they evolve. I thought that the fairy tales in this book wove Tiến's life and the fairy tales particularly well. Echoes in narrative were clearly seen and they were obviously there for a reason. At first, I wasn't sure exactly how the story was going to be framed, but once I understood that the parents and Tiến were reading together to learn English, it made a lot of sense. It made me wonder if the times my dad read stories to me when I was child were also a way for him to practice his English.
