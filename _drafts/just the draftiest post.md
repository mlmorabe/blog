The thing about movies and tv is that we can see people's bodies moving and acting, which  is something difficult to do while playing (online) or sitting in a chair, unless you're LARPing (I suppose). The other thing about movies and tv is that there is a camera that can zoom in and bring attention to what the director (cinematographer? i'm sorry I don't know) wants to highlight. And that's where... that's where the players and the game come in, I think.

 This is part of my attempt to watch media and think about how scenes are staged and framed, in an attempt to understand more about how scenes in games might be framed and paced.

In the time since I haven't been writing posts, I have been thinking a lot about writing, reading, and also collecting books to (eventually) read (and also traveling and finish work projects, but that's less exciting). I've also come up with several versions of this post in my head. My problem is: I've read too many things recently to be able to give them all individually the time and space that they deserve (luckily, there are many people out there writing book/story reviews!), but there are also so many things that I just want to shout about and tell people how excited I was about them. So what I'll do, I think, is play favorites with some of the short stories I've read, shout out one or two cool things about those favorites, and then pair them up with a game or other piece of media that they made me think about for more of those vibes.
