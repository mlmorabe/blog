This post is just a tribute to my favorite things in games, when people describe how their hands lingered on each others.

It's no surpise that a genre of movie or tv that I love is the "people looking longingly at each other for a long time and maybe there's a jaw twitch or hand flex" genre.

I've been thinking a lot recently about descriptions of movement and actions in games. This is part of my attempt to watch media and think about how scenes are staged and framed, in an attempt to understand more about how scenes in games might be framed and paced. The thing about movies and tv is that we can see people's bodies moving and acting, which  is something difficult to do while playing (online) or sitting in a chair, unless you're LARPing (I suppose). The other thing about movies and tv is that there is a camera that can zoom in and bring attention to what the director (cinematographer? i'm sorry I don't know) wants to highlight. And that's where... that's where the players and the game come in, I think.

Anyway, part of the reason I'm thinking about this is because I'm one of those people that goes absolutely feral for a lingering hand touch, a little hand spasm, a tight grip of the hand... I like the little micro movements of tension and you can be guaranteed that if that is in a game I am playing in, there will be an explosion of love in the chat. 

And beyond the micro, I've realized that describing a character's body language, what they're doing in the moment can help build an idea of what the character is doing in the scene, or how they're feeling, or who they are as a character. And it can tell you when they're doing thigns that are different, because maybe something has changed inside to touch upon their external.

The thing that's different is, when playing, it feels like it takes more work to remember that you can describe what your character is doing, instead of responding in conversation. I've played a lot of scenes where we just talk and there's nothign at all wrong with that! Dialogue is important! But it also helps me to ground the dialogue or the conversation in action. 

I started thinking about games where there are mechanics to support the description of action (outside of combat, which is another area where it is useful to ground things in action). The first thing that leapt to my head were Firebrands games (by Vincent and Meguey Baker). They developed a system of prompts. This can be seen to particularly great effect in the minigames "A Dance" and "Meeting Sword to Sword". Through these prompts, they develop a keen physical connection between the characters and this is soemthing that has been carried to other games based on that system.

I think this might be something that prompt based games do well. They put the part where teh GM asks "and what does it look like?" into the text and they provide an example of what it looks like. see also a long night in the mech bay

Sometimes, moves in games provide a little bit of guidance. In pasion de las pasiones there's a move you can use if you're physically touching someone while riling them up. In monsterhearts there's a move that rewards lithe movement. 

A little bit more flexibly, Star-Crossed moves encourage the description of movements (an unlimited move) but places a particular importance on where the characters touch and the order of the touch. There's a weight given to intentional vs unintentional touches, imposing meaning on the moments due ot the limited number of times it can occur in the game or the scene. I think this game encourages thinking about where the characters interact physically, much like a dance.

I play a lot of good society, and while there's not exactly mechanics built in for movement description, there's still that "things we want to see" section, and you can bet I type in things like "one (1) hand touch" or "a hand under the chin..." 

Of course, along with describing movements and actions, I think it's important to respect the autonomy given to characters to refuse a touch or manipulation. It's always polite to ask another player if it's okay that you touch their character or whatever, I think, especially if you odn't know them well. And always it's fine to say, no, i'd rather not be touched. 

Anyway, I'm just here to say I love to hear actions described. There's probably a balance to be reached between too much description and not enough and honestly the're not a right or wrong amount. Sometimes dialogue and feelings are more important than what people are doing, but you can also retroactively say "while we're doing this, I've been blah..."

I like the way games become cinematic affairs in my head and I want to learn from how actions are described/shown in different media.
