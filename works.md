* My game design work is found at my [itch.io](http://yayforbooks.itch.io) page. Right now my supplemental Skin for Monsterhearts 2, [the Swan](https://yayforbooks.itch.io/the-swan-mh2-skin), is available.
* I turned a playthrough of [Anamnesis](https://blinkingbirchgames.itch.io/anamnesis) by [Blinking Birch Games](https://itch.io/profile/blinkingbirchgames) into [a twine game](/Genesis_Enhancement_Protocol__Stage_1.html)! This playthrough was inspired by a character I played in a run of a Mecha hack of the game [Good Society](https://storybrewersroleplaying.com/good-society/?v=7516fd43adaa).
* There are some videos (and playthroughs I should finish one day...) on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/yayforbooks).
* Elsewhere on YouTube, I've played a lot of games through the [Gauntlet](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/) and a number of them were recorded and posted on the [Gauntlet's YouTube account](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheGauntletRPG/featured)! This is where I started playing games online and I'm very lucky to have played in many great games with the people there. Here are a few of my most memorable games that I still think about months (and years, I suppose) later:
    * My very very first time playing a Powered by the Apocalypse game! This was my first time playing [Night Witches](https://bullypulpitgames.com/games/night-witches/), by Jason Morningstar, in a game that was part of a year-long series playing through the campaign. Extremely memorable to me because my first character did not make it through her first mission, but I made a new character the next week and played her for almost a year (and there was a slow burn romance thrown in): [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rL-baoDZLLs)
    * [Hearts of Wulin](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/hearts-of-wulin.html)! I've had a chance to play this game of wuxia melodrama A Lot and it's so great! To be honest, I was very unfamiliar with the genre before I started playing and then I was like "I have to do research" and started watching the Untamed, but it wasn't until the pandemic struck that I really found myself diving into a lot of wuxia and xianxia c-dramas (and watching the Untamed like three times and then reading fan translations of the novel... anyway, it was an anchor in a stressful time). But some of my favorite RP moments have come from series of HoW:
        * [Measure of the Soul](https://youtu.be/L0P0jxrVSP8) - a series with supernatural drama and mystery and attractive demons
        * [Immortal Throne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF8PasfSpKk) - a series with supernatural mysteries and also struggle for a throne!
    * [The Gauntlet Reading Club: The Chosen and the Beautiful (Urban Shadows)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL26DVDSsqVz4tGiypgACdarW9NO2sB0Bm) - we discuss Nghi Vo's *The Chosen and the Beautiful* and play a game of [Urban Shadows](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/magpiegames/urban-shadows-second-edition) in a setting inspired by the game!
    * [Tales from the Low Cantrefs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw86YMzwc1E&list=PL26DVDSsqVz6IaNFZZTHNBUgv2gowbtv6&index=12) - this is a beautiful game that I'm so happy to have had a chance to playtest as [it's still in development](https://gamesfromthewildwood.itch.io/)! It's inspired by tales such as the Old Kingdom series by Garth Nix and the Chronicles of Prydain, both of which I count as formative books in my love of fantasy as a child. 
* There are so many more games that I've played, but to include them all would take more space! Maybe I'll blog about them retroactively one day... in the meantime, I probably yell about them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yayforbooks)!
