I" <p>It’s no surpise to anyone, that I, a self-described lover of yearning, absolutely go feral for a lingering hand touch, a little hand spasm, a tight grip of the hand… you know what I’m talking about. I love the little micro movements of tension that people sometimes describe in games, and you can bet that if I’m watching a scene unfold where someone reaches forward to touch someone else’s cheek, I am dying in the chat. My favorite genre of visual media (and, let’s face it, any media) is the “people looking longingly at each other for a long time and maybe there’s a jaw twitch or hand flex and they really want to express their feeling but just <em>can’t</em>” genre.</p>

<p>Anyway, <strong>I’ve been thinking a lot recently about how I describe my character’s movements and actions in games</strong>. While I watch things on Netflix, I’ve assigned a part of my brain to consider what I can learn from how characters interact with each other and how their actions and body language might help build an idea of what they’re thinking, feeling, or otherwise reveal a part of their internal self. Like, what does the slight hesitation before someone turns away mean? What does it mean if someone angles their body away while talking to someone and talks at the wall instead?</p>
