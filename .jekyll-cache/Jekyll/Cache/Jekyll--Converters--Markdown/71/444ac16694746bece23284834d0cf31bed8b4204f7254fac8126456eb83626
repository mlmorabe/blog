<p>Hello! Iâ€™m Maria (she/her). Iâ€™m a queer ~.75 gen Filipino-American currently living in the Midwest with my partner and our cat, Lotus. I study mathematical computational biology in my undergraduate years before pursuing a PhD in Microbiology. Currently, I do some remote research support involving antibiotic resistance genes, but my love of marine microbes, fundamental microbiology, and ocean biochemistry still lingers.</p>

<p>I have too many hobbies. I dabble in sewing, fiber arts (knitting and crocheting), dice making, ceramics, photography, and woodturning. My major interests and the focus of this site are reading books and playing games.</p>

<p>You can find me on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/yayforbooks">@yayforbooks</a>, where I am probably fangirling about books, games, dramas, artâ€¦ anything, really.</p>
