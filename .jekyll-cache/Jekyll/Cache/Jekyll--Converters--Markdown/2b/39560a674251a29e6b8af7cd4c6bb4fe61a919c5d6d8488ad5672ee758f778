I"s<p>Look, dearest darlings, I am a chronic starter. I have a draft list full of unfinished ideas jostling to be the ones to the finish line (but then the sport metaphor changes and there isn’t a finish line and it’s all really a mess). But despite all that and my inability to finish any post I started for this blog, I did still do some things in the year 2022!</p>
