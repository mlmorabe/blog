I"ú<p>Ages ago in grad school, I toyed with the idea of writing a ‚ÄúBest of [x] year‚Äù list for myself. Unfortunately, as many things in grad school go, this was an idea that seemed grand for a minute until faced with the reality of time management and motivation. For the purpose of this post, though, I thought I‚Äôd look at what I was feeling strong feelings about in 2019.</p>

<p>```Books of the year (those that have stuck with me):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Song of Achilles (so sad)</li>
  <li>Half-Witch (kinda weird but so good)</li>
  <li>Witchmark (adorable!)</li>
  <li>Girl in the Green Silk Gown / Sparrow Hill Road (so good)</li>
  <li>Long Way to a Small Angry Planet (so sweet)</li>
  <li>The Bone Witch (so sad)</li>
  <li>The Poppy War (so sad)</li>
  <li>Nimona (so sweet and sad)</li>
  <li>Under the Pendulum Sun (so weird)</li>
  <li>Unmasked by the Marquess (so sweet)</li>
</ul>

<p>Comfy/cozy reads:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Snowspelled</li>
  <li>Odd Spirits</li>
</ul>

<p>Reads that I keep going back to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Secret Casebook of Simon Feximal</li>
  <li>Magpie Lord series</li>
  <li>Ruin of a Rake</li>
  <li>Uprooted</li>
  <li>Just Like Heaven```</li>
</ul>
