I":<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello! I’m Maria (she/her). I’m a queer ~.75 gen (or whatever it’s called when you immigrate as a baby, spend too many years assimilating and now get to spend more years unlearning many things) Filipino-American currently living in the Midwest with my partner and our cat, Lotus. I studied mathematical computational biology in my undergraduate years before pursuing a PhD in Microbiology. Currently, I do some remote research support involving antibiotic resistance genes, but my love of marine microbes, fundamental microbiology, and ocean biochemistry still lingers.</p>

<p>My main interests (and probably what I’ll talk about most) are books and tabletop roleplaying games, but I have too many hobbies and a propensity to throw myself into new things to be enthusiastic about. I dabble in sewing, fiber arts (knitting and crocheting), dice making, ceramics, photography, writing, and woodturning. I get very excited about TV shows! I permanently speak with an exclamation mark after everything I say!</p>

<p>You can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/yayforbooks">@yayforbooks</a> (for now), where I am probably fangirling about books, games, dramas, art… anything, really.</p>
