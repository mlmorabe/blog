I"’<p>Itâ€™s the third day of the New Year! Weâ€™ve made it past that week between the 25th and the 1st where nothing felt real and time was a lie. Suddenly, weâ€™re at the part where itâ€™s just another day in another year and we start to settle in and that special sparkle of the first begins to fade (or at least, thatâ€™s how I feel).</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve fallen down a rabbit hole into bookbinding and thatâ€™s taken up my attention for the past few days. (More on that later!) My big project right now is typesetting a <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/6737/pg6737-images.html">public domain translation</a> of JosÃ© Rizalâ€™s <em>Noli Me TÃ¡ngere</em> which is a classic of Philippine literature that Iâ€™ve just never read. And now Iâ€™m reading it and itâ€™s very good? (Iâ€™m sitting here, a Jane Austen fan, screaming at social commentary and drama through the lens of visiting other peopleâ€™s houses, but also screaming because colonialism) (More on this later, too, probably)</p>

<p>But anyway, on the subject of the title of this post: saying what Iâ€™m doing so that maybe a future me will be guilt-tripped by present me into actually doing it!</p>
