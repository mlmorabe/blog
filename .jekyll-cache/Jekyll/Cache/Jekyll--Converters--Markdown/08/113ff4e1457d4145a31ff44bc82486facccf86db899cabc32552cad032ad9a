  <li>My game design work is found at my <a href="http://yayforbooks.itch.io">itch.io</a> page. Right now my supplemental Skin for Monsterhearts 2, <a href="https://yayforbooks.itch.io/the-swan-mh2-skin">the Swan</a>, is available.</li>
  <li>I turned a playthrough of <a href="https://blinkingbirchgames.itch.io/anamnesis">Anamnesis</a> by <a href="https://itch.io/profile/blinkingbirchgames">Blinking Birch Games</a> into <a href="/Genesis_Enhancement_Protocol__Stage_1.html">a twine game</a>! This playthrough was inspired by a character I played in a run of a Mecha hack of the game <a href="https://storybrewersroleplaying.com/good-society/?v=7516fd43adaa">Good Society</a>.</li>
  <li>There are some videos (and playthroughs I should finish one day‚Ä¶) on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yayforbooks">YouTube channel</a>.</li>
  <li>Elsewhere on YouTube, I‚Äôve played a lot of games through the <a href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/">Gauntlet</a> and a number of them were recorded and posted on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheGauntletRPG/featured">Gauntlet‚Äôs YouTube account</a>! This is where I started playing games online and I‚Äôm very lucky to have played in many great games with the people there. Here are a few of my most memorable games that I still think about months (and years, I suppose) later:
    <ul>
      <li>My very very first time playing a Powered by the Apocalypse game! This was my first time playing <a href="https://bullypulpitgames.com/games/night-witches/">Night Witches</a>, by Jason Morningstar, in a game that was part of a year-long series playing through the campaign. Extremely memorable to me because my first character did not make it through her first mission, but I made a new character the next week and played her for almost a year (and there was a slow burn romance thrown in): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rL-baoDZLLs">here</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/hearts-of-wulin.html">Hearts of Wulin</a>! I‚Äôve had a chance to play this game of wuxia melodrama A Lot and it‚Äôs so great! To be honest, I was very unfamiliar with the genre before I started playing and then I was like ‚ÄúI have to do research‚Äù and started watching the Untamed, but it wasn‚Äôt until the pandemic struck that I really found myself diving into a lot of wuxia and xianxia c-dramas (and watching the Untamed like three times and then reading fan translations of the novel‚Ä¶ anyway, it was an anchor in a stressful time). But some of my favorite RP moments have come from series of HoW:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://youtu.be/L0P0jxrVSP8">Measure of the Soul</a> - a series with supernatural drama and mystery and attractive demons</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF8PasfSpKk">Immortal Throne</a> - a series with supernatural mysteries and also struggle for a throne!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL26DVDSsqVz4tGiypgACdarW9NO2sB0Bm">The Gauntlet Reading Club: The Chosen and the Beautiful (Urban Shadows)</a> - we discuss Nghi Vo‚Äôs <em>The Chosen and the Beautiful</em> and play a game of <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/magpiegames/urban-shadows-second-edition">Urban Shadows</a> in a setting inspired by the game!</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw86YMzwc1E&amp;list=PL26DVDSsqVz6IaNFZZTHNBUgv2gowbtv6&amp;index=12">Tales from the Low Cantrefs</a> - this is a beautiful game that I‚Äôm so happy to have had a chance to playtest as <a href="https://gamesfromthewildwood.itch.io/">it‚Äôs still in development</a>! It‚Äôs inspired by tales such as the Old Kingdom series by Garth Nix and the Chronicles of Prydain, both of which I count as formative books in my love of fantasy as a child.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There are so many more games that I‚Äôve played, but to include them all would take more space! Maybe I‚Äôll blog about them retroactively one day‚Ä¶ in the meantime, I probably yell about them on <a href="https://twitter.com/yayforbooks">Twitter</a>!</li>
