I"ã<p>Hello! Welcome to this very untidy and contentless bit of the internet where one day Iâ€™ll plant some seeds of ideas and theyâ€™ll sproutâ€¦ Or something. Itâ€™s all very muddled. But eventually, what will live here will be my thoughts on games, books, and other media, as well as hopefully some original works. And cat pictures. This is all very much an experiment in writing longer things that Tweets and also an experiment in learning a teeny bit of web development. Iâ€™m not trained in either writing (I mean, there was school and then college and then grad school, but nothing formally in the world of literature) or coding (aside from the several classes in Python), so Iâ€™m excited to learn as I go and hopefully improve.</p>
